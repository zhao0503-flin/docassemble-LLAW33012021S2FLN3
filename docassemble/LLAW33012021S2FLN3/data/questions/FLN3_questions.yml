 Under section 54A of the Disability Discrimination Act it is not unlawful for an accommodation provider to request, that someone with an assistance animal produces evidence that the assistance animal is trained by an accredited training body to meet standards of hygiene and behavior appropriate for an animal in a public place.
 
 If you choose to submit a complaint to the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission will consider all the facts of the complaint you have submitted to determine whether an act of discrimination has taken place.
